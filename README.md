PROJECT CREATE TODO API
### Introduction

Creating a restful Todo List API where users can manage their to-do lists and todo items with ruby on rails, using TDD to implement the API, adding token-based authentication with JWT, versioning the API, serializing with active model serializers, and adding pagination features.
